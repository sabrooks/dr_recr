# drrecr (DR Recr)
drrecr (DR Recr) is a set of tools for evaluating (reconciling) a demand response DR event.  There are three tools:
1. Classify similar days
2. Define a demand response
3. Evaluate the demand response event using several methods.  Methods include:
  + 10 prior similar days average
  + 2 hour prior minimum
  + 30 minute prior minimum
  + 5 minute prior minimum
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#DR Event Definition
event_1 <- dr_event(ymd_hm("2015 3 19 9:50"), hours(3), energy, Time)

#Use output of dr_event to evaluate the event
eval_event(event_1)

```


```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>",
  fig.path = "README-"
)
```
